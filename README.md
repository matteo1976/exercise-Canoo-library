# Description:
I did this exercise to apply for the position of Web Developer.
Exercise simulates the operation of an online library; I simulated the db by inserting a file json Books.json.
I developed a small part of the back-end in order to be able to develop the front-end.
The front-end has been realized with Angular6 and Bootstrap
I created a simple and responsive design. 
I simulated and implemented the search by author and title of the book.
The creation and insertion of a new book was only partially developed.
